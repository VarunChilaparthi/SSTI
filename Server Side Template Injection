ServerSideTemplateInjection
I've tried to emulate Server Side Template Injection using flask web-framework.

Server-Side Template Injection

Server-side template injections (SSTI) are vulnerabilities that let the attacker inject code into such server-side templates. In simple terms, the attacker can introduce code that is actually processed by the server-side template. This may result in remote code execution (RCE)
Steps
pip3 install Flask

pip3 install virtualenv

On Linux
mkdir SSTIProject
cd SSTIProject
python3 -m venv venv
On Windows
mkdir SSTIProject
cd SSTIProject
p3 -m venv venv
Windows: set FLASK_APP=hello.py

Linux: export FLASK_APP=hello.py

All you have to do now is run

flask run
